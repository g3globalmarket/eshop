The fix is applied. The diff matches the requirements:

- Added `import dynamic from "next/dynamic";`
- Removed the static import of `RichTextEditor`
- Added a dynamic import with `ssr: false` to prevent server-side loading

This prevents `react-quill-new` from accessing `document` during SSR, resolving the "document is not defined" error. The component will only load on the client side, and the page should build and run without SSR crashes.

The fix is minimal and targeted—only the import mechanism changed; the component usage in the JSX remains the same.
