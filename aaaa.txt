## Fix complete — build passes

### Summary

**1. Type declaration file created:**
- `apps/user-ui/src/types/axios.d.ts` — module augmentation for axios types

**2. TypeScript configuration:**
- No changes needed — `apps/user-ui/tsconfig.json` already includes `**/*.ts`, which matches `.d.ts` files
- The type declaration file is automatically included

**3. Build validation:**
- Ran `pnpm nx build user-ui` — build completed successfully
- No TypeScript errors about `requireAuth` property
- All 27 pages compiled successfully
- Exit code: 0

### Files changed

**New file:** `apps/user-ui/src/types/axios.d.ts`
```typescript
import "axios";

declare module "axios" {
  export interface AxiosRequestConfig<D = any> {
    requireAuth?: boolean;
    isProtected?: boolean;
  }

  export interface InternalAxiosRequestConfig<D = any> {
    requireAuth?: boolean;
    isProtected?: boolean;
  }
}
```

**No tsconfig changes needed** — the existing `**/*.ts` pattern already covers `.d.ts` files.

The TypeScript error is resolved. The module augmentation extends both `AxiosRequestConfig` and `InternalAxiosRequestConfig` with `requireAuth` and `isProtected`, so TypeScript recognizes these properties in your axios interceptors. Runtime logic remains unchanged.
